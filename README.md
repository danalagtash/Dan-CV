## About me

I am soon to be a graduated computer scientist looking for a challenging internship opportunity, where I can use my creativity, apply my 
skills and expand my knowledge. At the university, we have had variety of projects with different toolsets. This experience give me the
ability to think out of the box when solving code challenges and implementing features. Specifically, Web development projects are the ones
that always get me most existed and geeking all night. Designing and developing a frontend is awesome, and I love it. I prioritize my daily
tasks, implement important features first and postpone fine-tuning to the end. I enjoy coffee talks and love getting to know new people,
especially from different cultures. I paint from time to time and always seeking a perfect photo shot.
